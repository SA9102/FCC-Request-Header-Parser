This project was created for freeCodeCamp, as part of the Back End Development and APIs course.

Date of completion: 9th March 2023.

NOTE: The code on Replit will be a little different to the code on this repository. The Replit code contains some extra files and lines of code needed in order for freeCodeCamp to ensure that the program passes the tests.
